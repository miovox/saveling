# 🚀 Deployment Ready Checklist

Your Saveling project is now ready for Vercel deployment with Neon database branching!

## ✅ Completed Setup

### Database Branching
- ✅ **Neon development branch** created and configured
- ✅ **Neon main/production branch** maintained for production
- ✅ **Environment switching** system implemented
- ✅ **Database isolation** between development and production

### Environment Configuration
- ✅ **Environment files** created for development and production
- ✅ **Switching scripts** for easy environment management
- ✅ **Package.json commands** for streamlined workflow
- ✅ **Production build testing** verified successful

### Vercel Ready
- ✅ **Vercel configuration files** created
- ✅ **Monorepo structure** properly configured
- ✅ **Environment variable templates** documented
- ✅ **Deployment guide** comprehensive and ready

## 🎯 Next Steps: Deploy to Vercel

### 1. Create Vercel Project
```bash
# Go to vercel.com and create new project
# Import from GitHub repository
# Set Root Directory: apps/web
# Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

#### Production Environment Variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-main-branch-connection-string"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-production-domain.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-production-secret"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

#### Preview Environment Variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-development-branch-connection-string"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-preview-url.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-preview-secret"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 3. Deploy
- Push to GitHub main branch → **Production deployment**
- Push to feature branches → **Preview deployments**

## 📋 Available Commands

### Environment Management
```bash
pnpm env:dev         # Switch to development environment
pnpm env:prod        # Switch to production environment  
pnpm dev:fresh       # Switch to dev + start development server
```

### Deployment Preparation
```bash
pnpm deploy:check    # Test production build + run tests
pnpm secrets         # Generate new NextAuth secrets
```

### Database Operations
```bash
pnpm db:generate     # Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:migrate      # Run database migrations
pnpm db:studio       # Open Prisma Studio
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
pnpm dev:fresh       # Start development with development database
# Develop features...
# Test locally on development branch
```

### Feature Deployment
```bash
git push origin feature-branch    # Creates preview deployment
# Test in preview environment with development database
```

### Production Release
```bash
pnpm deploy:check                 # Verify production readiness
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main             # Deploys to production
```
