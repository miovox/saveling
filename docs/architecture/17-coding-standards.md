# Section 17: Coding Standards

* **Critical Rules:** Enforce type sharing from the `packages/shared-types` directory; use the API service layer for all frontend data fetching; do not access the database directly from API routes; use immutable state patterns.
* **Naming Conventions:** Standard conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks and services, etc.) will be followed.
