# Section 16: Testing Strategy

* **Pyramid:** Focus on a large base of Unit Tests, a smaller layer of Integration Tests, and defer End-to-End tests for later phases.
* **Organization:** Tests will be co-located with the source code they are testing (e.g., `Button.test.tsx`).
* **Tools:** Jest and React Testing Library.
