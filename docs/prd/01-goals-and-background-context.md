# Section 1: Goals and Background Context

**Goals**

- Deliver a functional Phase 1 product within one month that allows a family to set up profiles and manage allowances via manual transactions.
- Provide a simple, intuitive interface for parents to manage family profiles and financial buckets, and for children to easily view their balances.
- Establish a stable technical foundation to support Phase 2 features, including allowance automation and the lessons module.
- Gather critical, real-world feedback from internal family use and a small beta group to validate the core concept and inform future development.

**Background Context**
Saveling addresses the growing need for a digital tool that helps parents manage allowances while actively teaching children financial literacy. Current solutions often fail to be truly educational or engaging for kids, functioning more as simple digital wallets. This PRD outlines the requirements for the initial launch of Saveling, focusing on the core manual transaction and account management features. This foundational version will validate the core user experience and provide a stable platform upon which to build the automated and educational features outlined in the project's phased rollout plan.
