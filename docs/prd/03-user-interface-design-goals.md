# Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The UX will be clean, intuitive, and encouraging. For adults, the experience should feel efficient and trustworthy, providing clarity at a glance. For children, the experience must be fun, visually engaging, and highly interactive, using gamification principles to make learning about finance feel like play, not a chore.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**

- **Dual-Mode Interface:** The app will present a fundamentally different UI for 'Adult' and 'Child' profiles, tailored to their distinct needs.
- **Visual Finance:** For children, financial concepts will be represented visually (e.g., icons, simple charts) rather than with dense tables or text.
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** The interface will prioritize ease of use, showing only what's needed for the task at hand and avoiding overwhelming users.

**Core Screens and Views (for Phase 1)**

1.  Family Login Screen
2.  Profile Picker Screen
3.  Adult Dashboard (Overview of all child balances & recent transactions)
4.  Child Dashboard (View of their own balances & recent transactions)
5.  Profile Management Screen
6.  Bucket Management Screen
7.  Manual Transaction Form

**Accessibility**
The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

**Branding**
The UI will feature a clean, card-based layout with rounded corners. Typography will use 'Poppins' for headlines and 'PT Sans' for body text. The visual identity should be cheerful and encouraging, utilizing playful icons and subtle, positive animations.

**Target Device and Platforms**
The application will be a Web Responsive application, optimized for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.
