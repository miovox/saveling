# Section 4: Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure**
A **Monorepo** structure is recommended to simplify development by allowing for shared TypeScript types between the frontend and backend, easier dependency management, and a unified build and test process.

**Service Architecture**
The recommended approach is **Serverless**, with API functions hosted on the same platform as the frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). This is cost-effective, scales automatically, and integrates seamlessly with a React frontend.

**Testing Requirements**
The project will follow a balanced testing strategy. **Unit tests** are required for all new business logic and UI components. **Integration tests** are required for critical user flows.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

- A CI/CD pipeline should be established from the beginning to automate testing and deployments.
- The backend API will be built on the Node.js runtime.
